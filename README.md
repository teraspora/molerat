# Molerat Messenger: A simple UDP subnet messenger program

## Requires Python 3: run in terminal: `python3 molerat.py`

Run it on another computer too, and send text messages back and forth.

Note: the program uses UDP, which does not guarantee delivery; some messages may therefore not arrive, and so the program should not be used for critical systems.

So far only tested on two Linux boxes.   Needs testing on Windows and OSX.
