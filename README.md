# Molerat Messenger: A simple UDP subnet messenger program

## Requires Python 3: run in terminal: "python3 molerat.py"

## Run it on another computer too, and send text messages back and forth.

## Note: the program uses UDP, which does not guarantee delivery; some messages may therefore not arrive, and so the program should not be used for critical systems.
